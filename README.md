# Ring-light-flash
What does this do?

This is a small Python program meant for a Raspberry Pi 3 B running Raspbian Buster Lite, and utilizing Python 2.7. The premise behind it is to control a 12v 100mA Ring Light over GPIO by sending a signal to a Transistor using GPIO Pin 6 (GPIO_18)

Ideally, this program is meant for FRC vision development using a open source vision application like Chameleon Vision. The design of the coprocessor is up to you, but this application is just meant for giving you control over the state of the ring light.
